Part 1: GitHub + IDE Workflow (10 points) 
a) Sign up for Github
  I have been approved as a student for GitHub education. 

b) GitHub Tutorial from the Web UI
  I followed the Hello World tutorial and got myself familiar with GitHub

c) Why Use Git and Version Control?
  Version control, or source control, is the process of tracking and managing changes to software code. This is    specifically helpful for DevOps teams since they help reduce development time and increase successful            deployments. In addition, since version control keeps track of every change made, mistakes can easily be         traced and corrected through comparison of code.
  Git is a distributed version control system that is free and open source designed with performance, security,    and flexibility in mind. The main benefits of Git are a long-term change history of every file, branching and    merging, and easy traceability. Some SCM best practices include, often commits, ensuring you work from the       latest version, make detailed notes, review changes before committing, use branches, and agree on a workflow.

d) Git from the Command Line 
  I installed Git and have been using GitBash to run this HW from the command line. 

e) Cloning the Tutorial Repo Locally
  Changed path and cloned successfully.

f) Committing Changes from the Command Line
  Added file and commit successfully.
